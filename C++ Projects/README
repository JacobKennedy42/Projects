# Projects
A collection of personal projects throughout the years.
All projects included were created either in my free time (independent of academic course work), or done for a course but not chosen specifically by the instructor. All explicitly assigned academic assignments have been excluded.
Instructions on how to run each project are located in each project's README

Project of Note:
	QNet Prototype
