i've had many good years. but the new one is still too new to tell and mosty has not happened yet

holy crap no
song files are extremely valuable. one day you might end up as the only person on earth who has a certain song. i'm pretty sure i have some things that no one else has

36 is the range of the random number picked. has to be between 0 and 35. it's going to be converted to letters/numbers. so that's how many choices there are (26 letters, and 10 numbers). the '-1' means you start the variable "n" at -1. the (\d|\D)(?=,) is regex to search for every letter/number with a comma after. the x%n% means literally the letter x followed by whatever value n currently is. so if n is 5 then x%n% would be x5

are you there

so far i have hardly noticed
pretty good, i am slow playing it but i am still glad it exists

better than the world being covered with trash

you're welcome, i still have 90% of them left to make

they were

fine, but not so good about the amount of time it takes to get there and what may happen if people are trapped in a spaceship for that long

congratulations on this

cleaning my room

it's a simulation of trees which are in turn a simulation of broccoli

i don't care

flambonet, but that's just because it is year of the flambonet

both, in that case

ok

i don't recall manufacturing an elephant, it must have been a metaphor for something. let me check. oh yes, i found it. yes that unquestionably refers to the video 'history of the entire world, i guess', yes i did finish it

we'll see about that

no. i actually try to avoid it. it's too intense, the feeling that everyone in the world is staring at the calendar and thinking about the future. i actually succeeded in avoiding it today, i was doing grant abbitt tutorials and did not notice

a wise person once said to me, and i'm assuming this because everyone's wise, she said "are you sure you can really do this, because if you could do it then don't you think you would have done it already", now that might not seem like a very friendly thing to say, and i certainly didn't think so at the time, but that challenged me to spring into action, almost vengefully. i'm not suggesting you can or can't do anything but i thought i would relay this message which oddly enough jumpstarted my songwriting career

1 1

i'll see what i can do

gonna want to subscribe to some of the vampire magazines

holy smokes, you are very friendly

it's good, wondering if it's possible to add water to it

i'm having a count down timer

sure

if there isn't then that would create some interesting situations in japan i bet

that would make sense

<a href="keymash.png">this</a>

Wednesday. i am counting down the minutes untill it occurs .....

<a href="map.png">this</a>
i am utilizing keyboard maestro combined with karabiner, in a slightly unusual way

rock

it's new all 3 of those things

moment/second

that might not be the best way to make resolutions

bee movie

a speech nugget

yes, huge amounts of projects. it will be raining projects

in theory, yes

that all depends on what it looks like now

i haven't planned that far in advance

i was thinking of climbing around it to find out

actually,

that seems like a very good idea

that's true. also coming up soon, recommended for you based on your tastes and interests: february 29

good, it feels like a fresh breeze
yes, and i can grow stronger because of it

discuss, in more detail

yes

yes, those are very good. the only problem is that sometimes the seats don't actually go back far enough to use it. your head would fall forward. but it might work if you have a window seat, you can lean into the wall/corner

maybe shop around, see what other brands there are

no, that's you. this is me

5pombkxff2a6rf0

ah, it is ok

maybe first figure out how to prevent the extinction of our species

take it a step further, be like how you wish i was

yes, especially if they were actually an accident

i have no idea

person

yes but only after you've started. after you start (or try to start), if you are having any issues, let me know and i will help with those

it will melt, as long as you are in a reasonable climate

definitely hard ball
because i am strong

yes
that would depend on your starting point
yes
the song does easily come to mind. but if you happen to be on one of the really old trains (R32), which the A line still uses some of, it can be impossible to think of anything, those things are ridiculously loud

it will probably only take a few weeks, and i hope you live much longer than that

i can never remember what temperature it is

start talking about them and writing them down. that will bring you 1 step closer

no

that depends which octave the notes are in and especially what the bass is

yes

whoa slow down there, you have taken that entirely out of context

whenever it becomes illegal to release songs individually

i'll see what i can do

yes

only slightly

yes, that is somewhat true. also i am sure i have some demons that most people don't have, and don't have some that some people do have

there are no final forms. can always do more forms

not physically, but in writing yes

yes, or maybe just a quake

i don't know

i divide it into <a href="workwork.mp3">these categories</a>

update: fighting is cancelled

maybe about 500 per day

how about <a href="most-clever-question.php">this</a>

let him introduce you to another website

see if you can get on dr. phil together

this is an opportunity for you to invent one that's actually different

collect all 12

first of all i think you might be better off digitally, with computer files. because they are easier to store and manage without making a mess. ok, so, keep updating your 'random' category. this will be your good friend, as you get new ideas. that is fine. there is another job title which is going through the 'random' category, selecting one, and figuring out how to turn it into a more tangible project idea, like the others. What i would suggest to you is this: use a random number generator to choose a number based on how many projects there are, plus 1 for the random ideas category (so currently this number would be 7). i can recommend <a href="https://random.org">random dot org</a> for that. set the range from 1 to 7. (also you must assign numbers to the categories, so you know what the numbers mean). if it lands on the random category (7), then tangify 3 random ideas into actual project ideas, and use random dot org to select which ones from that category to do. then go back and do another random selection again (with a higher number this time, because hopefully you will have added more projects). Here's what i recommend: you must finish the project that is selected. If this seems too overwhelming, then I would recommend doing shorter projects until you are more confident in the procedure. some people are ok with bouncing between projects, but every time i've tried this, it simply turns into a license to escape. so these are my best recommendations

none. those ones fail. must make resolutions independently of new years. unless you want it to fail, in that case definitely a new years resolution is the way to go, you will forget all about it by jan 6

yes, it is. there are some stores i will not go in

sure

yes

yes, it claims there is a mistake but there is no mistake. which is unfortunately not true anymore because i found the mistake, which is no longer a mistake anymore because it has a mistake, yes the universe is imploding that's the mistake

i have

35

the best way is to experience it first hand, unless that would cause severe damage to something or someone

i'm not sure

yes

that would be extremely nice, not because of the new years date. i don't plan things around the new years date. but it would be nice because it is very soon. but alas i need more time still. throw me in jail, oops, i already am there

yes

bless them and then set them free

a way to convert trash into fresh water

that is due to me being a hypocrite

you may be right

a little bit

slush is the only thing that does it for me anymore

you don't wanna know

ah that is due to intelligence

i will be right over

my self
who the hell do you think you are

it's on my to do list

yes but now i have to prove it

36

fake

yes

only if i can do it without the wings

near the top but not the top

in all fairness,

the same as yours (it's you)

new year's resolutions are famous for failure. so when i make resolutions i am very careful to make sure that they have nothing to do with new years

innovate

thru the bottom?

37

for you

no way

banana

ear plugs is a good first step. the next step is get disappointed that it's impossible

yes

let me think

renovating

i am nromel

to mix it up from all those times i have answered in excrutiatingly honest truth and detail

it assists you in exploring files

get a piano keyboard, you might be able to see that way

it should be on the way from one convenience store to another

you are not supposed to. but sometimes if you are feeling creative you can bend the rules of whether or not you can force creativity

i think it's in 'movie star' after 'do you have a nice car'

roast it

fresh fruit and afternoon breeze

i will do a follow up

goals

big like ocean

i probably have no choice

how about one that goes back to the time travel store unless it works properly

i'm not sure. not recommended. don't try at home

i just remembered it's something from a video i made

in case i am special

i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes

what would a good question to ask you be?

i'm here doing renovations. i am renovating purgatory

hOW DID YOU KNOW

no, but that makes sense

in all honesty,

because it was made by exactly the same species of animal (person human)

i was gonna say i don't have any random keys, but then i remembered i do have a random key, and i will press it: euv9czkysa5s891

i would say it's a tie between bowling pin, bowling ball, and bowling shoe

not yet

yes, everything you just said is very advice

that would be a lot more than just releasing it, i would have to make the thing too. somehow it doesn't seem good for anyone if i go ahead and make a worse version of another video

it would be a good place for santa to live, considering the north pole does not usually have solid ground

have room? without those elements you mentioned, music would litterally not exist. the only thing calculably perfect is actual silence

someone's gotta do it
pots and pans,

i would prefer to go down the slide, into the dumpster

what the hell is drugs

i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite

that would ruin the core phenomenon which gives this page its distinct essence and purpose, which is that the questions come from people other than me

it sounds like you should pursue drama also

that would seem almost too convenient

yes there is a limited time offer if you sign up now, you can get a free gift bag

i have no idea

everyone is good, the hard part is proving it

it doesn't really matter what i think, but those markings are not because of any marijuana references. it's because they both contain the word 'fuck'

you might never know what it is unless it is something related to date and time

it's like another world, in your mind!

i don't care

show them care and love

i'm sure that could be arranged

yes but they're longer when they stand

first you must stop using the word 'procrastinate.' it's a very long word and it wastes a lot of time

i wonder if there is any possibility that you could re-locate to a more highly populated city. maybe one of the legendary ones

what the heck is a video

you'll wanna to go ahead and don't be alex jones

that's pretty good but at some point you and the demon should mingle with other bed demons

it's pretty good

could be due to hate

i have a tendency to delay it sometimes if something important is going on, which also inevitably causes waking up to also be delayed accordingly, at some point. but there is also a strong automatic tendency to fall asleep at the same time as the previous day(s), and also wake up at the same time as previous day(s)

ok

maybe if i wanted it to fail

it will probably seem very short despite actually being longer than most years

good
perhaps i still don't understand

more than i am ever expecting

yes

i'm a princess

body is the name for many other parts combined, including your head. it's like a word and a sentence

oh that's classic

E

you

use star wipes with additional star wipes to transition between each of the star wipes

that all depends on what the first one is

what the heck is a video

email

super stition

it can scratch an itch you haven't even gotten yet

back in my day we were afraid of comic books, and the telephone

i thought you already did

that's already mostly solved. the best way i was able to wrap my head around it is to always export the image sequence to the temp folder. let it overwrite, and as part of the video exporting procedure, i convert the image sequence into a video file, which automatically names itself based on the date and time. an extra challenge is that my preferred software for that sort of thing was quicktime 7 which is also gone. so i am using ffmpeg instead, and i have automated the whole procedure to a single button press using keyboard maestro, which is also what generates the dated file names. i still have no idea how anyone else manages files/exports from blender, but that is the way i am currently doing it. it's worth mentioning that the other tremendous hangup i had with blender in 2016 was the lack of save prompts, and the constant risk of so easily losing the project. but i was thrilled to see that save prompts are there now. and i also used keyboard maestro to get even more robust autosaves

a 3rd bench

here's a <a href="https://billwurtz.com/how-to-make-a-video.mp4">tutorial</a>

could be one of the secret ingredients

because they have been very friendly to me

make some of your own, and then i will have new ones for you to watch also

yes oops not anymore

oh heck yeah

it's a wonderful opportunity to breathe on someone

i have a question answering button. i actually have 2 so i can use both hands

not make enough mistakes

they make me stronger, and i do enjoy being strong
it doesn't matter. the founding principle of this questions page is that i should be able to handle any question

yes

i'm not sure, i am more focused on the current year i am in, which is july 2019 - june 2020

20 days will go by quickly no matter what. 20 days is a very short amount of time

i try to play it right down the middle

what country they are in

(tommy lee jones voice) 'couple'

i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite

i thought it would make me stronger and more robust, physically. which so far it definitely has

there is no panic button. i always wanted to panic on the internet

what kind of answer would you like to receive

you get to change, stay the same, and change between changing and staying the same

yes. i've tried the first way you mentioned, which is the way i think a lot of people do it, but i ultimately realized that that does not play to my strengths as well as if i write the whole thing first. not all instrumental details, but the lyric/melody/chord/tempo/roadmap exactly

it's this one, because each time i write 'this one', i have to delete it because that makes it look way too easy. and even when i say all this, that makes it look easy also so i will have to delete all this, and then it becomes a very difficult question because then i would have written a lot and had to abandon it. but if i just explain my thinking process, it becomes easier through honesty. and yet unfortunately the honesty becomes compromised when you consider that the thesis of my statement was that this is a hard question

forge your wizard ratings to way higher than they are, then try not to get caught

never heard of it

1

try some videos

fair enough

i don't have a melody but there is usually a breath after montana

words are actually very helpful for dealing with fear

all of them have been not used before because you will never run out of ways to play even just one chord, but especially multiple chords in a list

i would highly recommend for you to acquaint yourself with the piano keyboard. that is one of the most powerful devices available for communicating vast amounts of musical information, very humanly and efficiently, to computers

holy smokes, you are very friendly

500 trillion or less, depending on how much airspace you count

i haven't entirely planned that far ahead

when it gains more acceptance in our society

nothing

learning is automatic, as long as you patiently continue to do the things and go to the places

i thought there was only 1 letter
i have the original thing

buy yourself some time by telling other people you are about to tell someone something

i am cursed

no but i will un tune all day

you could try those political campaign signs

adult carrot

it is the 3rd strongest blimp, after the good and bad year blimps

it's bad luck for me to name your scarf, but if you want to accept the bad luck then you can name it pumpkin

that could be arranged

some trash,

yes but on top of that i also make fictional claims sometimes

all the tools for interestingness is right there in the dullness. it's still dull because you haven't used it yet

someone asked me for a favorite letter which i don't have so i held up a mirror and that was just what letter reflected off the mirror at that particular time

it makes me stronger but sometimes i am annoyed by all the strength

sulk into it, just because you don't often get the chance

if i knew i would know exactly, not roughly

what is wacky about any of those times
not very

2 weeks or die trying

guilt trip

why do you remind me of the entire zoo

that's not important right now

talk to the camera, lick the camera

do as much writing as you can

they're in there

it's not, that's a rumour

don't worry i will explain it to you in more details than you ever wanted

yes
stab the rice, you can stab 4 pieces at a time. very cool

hi

it's ok

only if you have 1 trillion or more

something tells me you're bluffing

sounds like you haven't yet had the pleasure of being bombarded with normalcy

goals

join as many bands as possible

when it improves more

yes!

yes, thank you for checking with me first

i regretfully do not know. we stand on the shoulders of giants

that would depend on its strength

breast

i have a button that types it

yes, and stupid

it's good but if you wanna read while playing you're gonna need very good eye sight

i actually have no idea. i will have some tips soon

not doing it

yes

this won't solve all you problems, but it will solve some of them: try doing much much much much much much shorter songs, to start out with. this will allow you to start finding solutions to all those problems, in a very bite size and manageable way

from what i have heard about it, i am excited

bricks?

i don't recall seeing either, but in deep impact morgan freeman is the president, so that's awesome

if what they say is true, it is the same thing as oatmeal. in which case it is very meaningful to me because it is quite healthy and i am reasonably comfortable with eating it. only problem is how the hell do i make it

hit with stick

selena gomez 'back to you', when i was preparing it for that list a few questions back. i had never actually gotten a chance to listen to it up close, and that climactic chorus riff/groove section i found to be spectacularly en pointe, even more than i had previously thought

F

i know the exact solution that works for this, and this turned out very important for me: you must write the song first, without touching the keyboard. preferably in a different location. if you don't have any language to conceive of music on paper while away from an instrument, you can develop one, or, you can get another instrument which you only use for writing, and a recording device and a text file to help manage the writing. figure out how the song goes, all the way through, before recording. you don't have to know every little instrumental part, but you should know the melody lyric chords and the exact length and road map and exact tempo all the way to the end. i find it very important to tell you this because i have been in your exact situation and this was the exact solution that saved me
i will think about it

the original one

see if you get physically ill when you don't do it

i must admit there are some similarities

i'd rather not worry about it

1

dynamic paint with waves

mittens

i have them all memorized in alphabetical order

that's one of life's great mysteries
i am pretty sure it is mostly universal
yes that's definitely true
i have studied this at great length, and i still don't have any great answers. what i can say is that our entire world is based on times, timing, and relationships between frequencies. music is able to deal with all those things, completely raw. so that may explain why it has the powers it has, but still doesn't explain exactly how they work. to figure that out would be to truly figure out the nature of consciousness, which by its very nature is extremely flexible and has a mind of its own (is a mind of its own). which might explain why it can be so impossible to find any rules for it

yes how did you know

holy smokes, you are very friendly

ah you must remember to always have a spare dinner. number 1 rule of dinner

oh tell me more

that is how you get points

the whole purpose of that continuum is messups. if you want to do messups i suggest get another continuum

stack it about 8 times higher than you want the pile to be, then when it falls over there's your pile

the good news is you are already there, the bad news is you can't leave

yes

holy smokes, you are very friendly

learning to do what i do

selling get rich quick schemes

holy smokes, you are very friendly

some people's package never arrives

imagine you can actually sing way higher than high, and pretend like you are singing down to the high note. don't act like the high note is your highest. pretend it is much lower than your actual highest

that sounds like too much fun to be legal

that's true

how about driving on the road. it's pretty cool, the roads get super empty at midnight

when you least expect

sure go ahead

jeff probst's last name steals the show entirely

put it in your savings account. that is the one thing this gift can do that no other gift can

you're gonna wanna go ahead and be a doorknob

too late, it's already been patented by the big egg corporation

i'm not sure it had any effect on my feelings as of just yet

holy smokes, you are very friendly

than, ?
oh for damn sure that's the case. they also have meaning for me. it's the same as with all music. very vivid and potent, juicy meaning. almost a liquid meaning. you can try to put it into words but that's probably never quite possible. each piece of music may have varying levels of potency for each person. it's the same thing as with personal relationships. and i am speaking for music in general

it's a lot more than new software, and a lot more than edit videos
no i am fine

every thing, 1 at a time

hydrogen and helium

i doubt it

that should be fine
as long as you don't call it a new years resolution
you must do it when the time seems exactly right
no need to avoid jan 1 nor gravitate toward it
yes
absolutely not

that's not true

might be the monday salamander one

oh that would explain those damn podiums

the long ones mean lamp and the short ones mean framp. hope that helps

distract them

because things are way too good. it's making you skeptical

ok, try to remain calm and describe whether the floor has carpet. do not panic unless the floor has carpet

i dropped myself on my head when i was young

normal. i am nromal

pepper

i have stood in many fields. most of them i could see the edges and zero of them were trespassing

i do stuff offline and then eventually when i get the courage i post it here with the date according to when it was first made, almost pretending it's been online all along, sort of

when provoked

sure

<a href="rug4ogcs0d1p8tefb8.jpg">this colour</a>

which one, no

so i can lift up the whole entire world

yes

i will take a look at it

it might be best with a curl, otherwise it could look like b, d, or p, if you have some type of rotational/orientational dislexia

bribe the judge, with 20 cents maybe

it was the most recent one i saw, at that time

i would say don't do it if you hate it. find something you actually like to do

you will be forever surrounded by people who appear to be not frolicking hard enough
you must teach

i don't know yet

tried to do sky writing on an overcast day

for a fair price

i know they can fly but i've never seen them do it

i can't tell you
categorizing somone like that isn't nice. at least i wouldn't feel good if someone did it to me

the

peter mayer 'it's good to have a friend', bonnie raitt 'not the only one', ginuwine 'differences', audrey assad 'restless', james taylor 'native son', nicki minaj 'fly', paul mccartney 'lindiana',  peter gabriel 'in your eyes', madonna 'i'll remember', selena gomez 'back to you', stevie wonder 'if it's magic'

i think you are doing fine. it seems you are a keen observer, and writer. there is a lot of energy that wants to get out, almost too much to comprehend. if you are impressed and struck by how awesome these people are (both of them seem to be instructors of some kind), and struck so strongly so as to write a diligent think-piece about it (as shown above, and before), then i can give you a hint as to what the future may hold, and that's you being every similar kind of awesome, all blended together with your own unique twist. but for someone with your depth of mind, it may take some time to develop. in the meantime, keep in touch with all your own ideas and thoughts and feelings, because these are what is going to develop into the strong guiding force that you likely are on track to be

that depends how good your social life / happiness already is currently

sounds like a lot of drama

too late, you are already way past it

you could write a normal love song and then at the last minute switch the lyric to hate, but keep the song otherwise the same. see what develops

wanted to make it even more canadian

i am a blackbelt in karate. that is not how i do it, that's just another idea for you which also happens to be not true

'hate you' by king's x

yes but i know you already knew that

try to act naturally

you could re invent the egg. it's damn near time that thing got a re invent

10:34

the hiss is a gift. will you not accept the gift of the hiss

oh man, that's gonna change everything

ask them what they are so busy doing, and if they would mind showing it to you, to compare

no. no one can make a meme. all you can do is go about your daily business and memes will grow from that

know

maybe but it has petrified

it is common to have a very nostalgic bias for whatever was happening around that age. that being said i prefer the ones with the flat edges, and i also didn't like them being so huge. so i'd say iphone 4 or 12

i think what happens is you actually play the same notes (the notes in the tritone, like E and Bb notes) but switch the bass- play F# instead of C. maybe you already knew that, but i couldn't quite figure out what you were asking

that is merely an echo of how our universe began

yes

i pick which ever one is not a head injury
not if someone else saves it first

good, i am learning how to do the skin. or fuck it maybe a skinless elephant would be the way to go

no

it seems it's only called religious when someone else does it

nebraska is bigger

they plan to pay for 2 but some vendors may generously offer admission for the price of 1. especially if they realize that perhaps only one of them wants to be there

that's only a coincidence

i may never decide

curious, inquisitive

holy cramp i've barely even started

yes, as long as you agree to save someone else at some point

usually 5 or 6. i always forget some

if i'm writing charts for myself, i just do a lead sheet with chord symbols. usually i just use treble clef, with the understanding that the male voice will actually read an octave down. i never really got comfortable with bass cleff, i'm not even totally comfortable reading in treble clef. however, reading rhythms i am a fire chief

go exploring for a while

having a favorite song wouldn't really be fair to all the songs you liked before or are gonna like later. or haven't even heard

good, but i prefer warm chocolate because it causes less injury to my inner mouth tissue

i was making non-youtube videos, and then a friend told me i'm an idiot for not putting them on youtube, so i did. they're still non-youtube videos, but you can watch them on youtube if you want
yes, but also outrageously fun. most of what i do is usually done by teams and companies of people, but i tend to do it all myself. so i get to enjoy all of the challenges, all the nightmares, and all the fun
holy smokes, you are very friendly

obviously

the opposite color of your eyes

you have to be sad at least some of the time. it helps you get a more objective outside viewpoint on happiness, which may help you get better at finding it, and better at recognizing it when it arrives

it's both. it's round and flat, like a pizza

i'm having a count down timer

3 or 4

i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite, and if i had a least favorite there is no way i would say it here because the result will be that everyone will go immediately watch it to see how bad it is

start with Emin and A if you play the guitar. or start with Cmin and F if you play the keyboard. with chords, it's much much less about thinking and more about feeling
you can literally make it be anything in the universe. and if that's not enough to send you into a life-long existential melt down, then i don't know what else is gonna do it for you

what exactly could paper tell you that the audio can't

for that kind of money i think you can buy an entire jeff bezos

<del>1 thousand</del>. 999

i always get it confused with beanut putter

it's wet

almost anything you can imagine. but i'll tell you one thing it's not, and that's WET

by starting again and again repeatedly

pretty good

no

i don't really know anything about the ethics of pets, i just have personal psychological issues about pets because when i was a kid we had a cat and a dog, and the dog ended up killing the cat, and then eventually we moved to a new house and i think we had to kill the dog. i'm pretty sure a lot of people have their pets killed if they can't house them anymore. because i'm assuming most people don't want to buy an old pet. also sometimes people mutilate their genitals ???? whatever. it's none of my business really, but a lot of times people do get very angry at me for simply stating that i would prefer not to own a pet. (<a href="12db2z6n58asfgi.html">example</a>)  and one day i just decided i don't want to be called a monster anymore, so i mostly don't talk about it

holy smokes, you are very friendly

i have no idea

legendary

i don't know
common sense probably

yes, although i can't prove it right now

i am trying to understand your situation, but you seemed to hold back on just enough details that i am still totally clueless about what is going on here. although you wrote it beautifully

the answer may surprise you

to explain to a beginner all the way up to the land of B# and Cb would probably be impossible. as it is, my paragraph was probably too long and they probably went to sleep during it. it's like, first you'd have to explain why B and C are only a half step apart instead of a whole step. that's probably weird enough for someone to get their head around. the B# issue would probably only become relevant after a person has fully absorbed the B-C half step issue. but to continue, which i don't know why i would because you must already know, but to continue, sometimes on paper you will see B# which is actually the same note as C. so the next question a person might ask is "why the heck would you ever say B# instead of C" which is a question i'm sure i have answered several times before, such as <a href="q.php?date=201811232328">11.23.18  11:28 pm</a>, or <a href="q.php?date=201705221259">5.22.17  12:59 pm</a> actually it looks like that second one actually takes you all the way through, so that's probably what i should have said in order to avoid being called on the complaint line

stamps

almost

yes

they are that leafy friend you always wanted

who is this

if you can combine both, that's the real magic

it's hard to tell which days are holi

have you considered editing and/or post-production
for me it is absolutely essential. i can't even build a lamp without making a dam TV show of it. but i'm beginning to think not everyone is quite like me

you could try making a burrow

the bad kind

a football

yes, and skeleton. i am a ghost skeleton

in all fairness,

i started making them outside of youtube, and posting them to the website. but then someone told me i was an idiot for not using youtube, so i started putting them on youtube
holy smokes, you are very friendly

absolutely not

none. those ones fail. must make resolutions independently of new years. unless you want it to fail, in that case definitely a new years resolution is the way to go, you will forget all about it by jan 6

how about different animations

just got home

one of the chinese ones

that sounds too right to be wrong

flipping out

rice

you wish

try this strategy: start thinking of things you definitely should not ask. that should get you started on a pretty good path

i do it like composing a sentence. which i don't know how i do, either. it just comes into my mind like magic. and if that doesn't work, it's usually because i've been thinking about it too hard. and it can help to take a brief break and then try again

they are beautiful. i could stare at them all day. especially if they're really clean

pretty good. i did my best. i haven't heard it since i made it but i felt like it came out ok at the time

almost everyone i've ever met says "thuh" unless the next word starts with a vowel sound

? if you are already trying then it seems you must already have one

i will decide later but i will tell you even later: at the show. actually we will just play the songs and you won't know until the song starts

yes!, hurry in

traveling to far away places very quickly. even over oceans

not anything
every thing

6 or 7, but you could never fit them through the hole. they would have to be born in there

hopefully this will inspire you to make your own thing

algeria is hot, actually they're both hot. Ok, here's something, algebra uses a lot of letters and numbers, which are also used for bra sizes

to hopefully *influence* you

try to catch that 5 seconds of sunlight each day

yes, but not necessarily related to the previous thing you said. and i also sometimes relate to the previous thing you said, but not necessarily on christmas
i don't think i remember my first christmas

it is good. it helps me accept responsibility for what i've done

in all fairness,

yes, specifically it's those 2 things merged together

it is simultaneously the biggest small state and the smallest big state. so in that way it is an extremely useful measuring tool, for figuring out if any state is big or small. just compare it to pennsylvania and bam there's your answer

which one

yes, but i also take vibrant solace in knowing that they will see quite a few of the mistakes and tests when archived and contextualized properly

that seems normal

it's a great concept, and it transformed my life. i am eager to do something very similar, possibly on a different day, and with updated credentials

quitemost possibly likely

some type of person, place, or thing

F

search to the ends of the earth for that one store that's open

for you

i agree entirely
well, when you put it that way, i am instantly reminded of the way cars changed the horse industry. and the way computers changed the paper industry. or any other transformation in human history. given the ubiquity of human transformation, over the centuries, it would feel hopelessly shortsighted to claim "oh no" and "it's bad" and "too bad the world sucks now", because people have been trying to say that for millennia and it's never been true. change is strange but it's also fun and good, and has the best intentions

for time to be expressed

start with the ones you currently are enjoying the most

new year's resolutions are so infamous for failure, i very meticulously make sure that my resolutions have no connection to 'new years'

because music generally uses families of notes that are not all equally related to each other. the piano, however, uses a full system of notes where each note is equally related to the next, but it's layed out in a way that you can easily skip some of them. the letter names of the notes were based on skipping some of them, because that's generally the trick to getting music to happen. so the spaces in between are called sharps and flats, but like i was saying before, to get that good music sound you wanna skip some notes but not all. and the letters are put on there based on having skipped some notes but not all. so some letter notes are direct next door neighbors (no sharp/flat in between). To explain that in a more real life setting, if you made a system of only 6 letters, with sharps placed between all of them, you would find that playing on only the plain letter keys would produce a very dizzy disoriented sound, akin to a time-warp or flashback scene. but instead the way the letters are actually arranged, this way you can just play the plain letter keys and automatically get something very friendly sounding, like joy to the world, right out of the box

because it's the same notes

yes, if i can bring something new to the table

part of my trick is answering them all at once, per day. or maybe twice
yes. everyone is themselves
i think the burden of proof is on you, to prove it's possible for anyone to actually not be themself

to give a response

that's ok

yes, all of that's true, but hopefully even more

to reference itself

yes. i think you're gonna have a better time with multiple walls

that's literally all i do. sorry, you've got the wrong person
i will look into it

maybe the 2 of you could write your differences into a dramatic piece of theater

that sounds like fun

i am very good at identifying traffic lights in pictures. my ancestor was a traffic light

christmas took thousands of years to be ruined. how are you gonna just waltz in and take the credit for it

the north star

it does not. wait actually yes it does, it seems there might have been an error in naming 'gravity.' it possibly should have been called "everything"

yes

sort of

it's pretty good

fine

only if i get to direct also

that's not true

approximately 63,826

it's difficult to imagine

i will check with my physicist

bags

100 metres

that's proposterous. who do you think i am

it makes me

it's you

i see what you mean

could be some type of mating ritual

yes. albert einstein tried to show us this

check to see if you already are

it's you. you are the day

new ones all the time

yes

better late than never

ah, COC. a tried and true classic

no

i thought i did but i realize i haven't yet

i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes

no. it is more likely based on much more recent experiences of real life stores closing due to the internet

you're king means you are king. your king means you are definitely not king

1 million pounds

swiss army knife is the potato of knives

yes but i can't prove it right now

that mostly depends on which hemisphere you are living in (north or south)

the sun

you're gonna have to make your own iphone. and when you do, can you make it an option to disable absolutely every transition animation? *bill murray voice* 'i'll give you a thousand dollars'

it's the other way around for me, because i am the author. the website is based largely on my thoughts

could be fun

the same way

no

yes but not on dec 25. that is way too predictable

ah, this is where the video would come in handy. it even tells you the definition, if i recall

it's pretty good. i also like paul's dis track of john, but make no mistake, they love each other

that seems so true

you're going to have to keep switching to different calendar systems

the same way you tell the difference between a dog and a horse (i can't)

the universe is supposed to be the name of the whole entire world entirely. so if anything purports to be outside of that, it largely chalks up to a language translation error

check-ups, diagnoses, perscription, surgery, birthing,

being stupid but that's just the beginning

sure

yes, despite its best efforts to be fake

the fastest and most reliable way is to become a movie producer. if you don't want to do that, then you will have to get a movie producer to like you, or get someone that the movie producer likes to like you, and so on

some sort of gosh dam miracle

i suppose it's me

let me think

that is just a side effect of being a demon

yes but i'm still here. i'm staying here

sure. this is made easier by the fact that everything is a poem

not flat enough. must flatten them more

it's better if you don't think about it

the first thing you wanna do is find 2 objects, and replace them with each other. switch their places

you
don't worry about it

no

it's very good, even though most people don't go to it

still are

thinking about the world
thinking about the world

that is just a side effect of being a demon

due to intelligence

no

no

if you've never tried it before, i would recommend it. it can change your life

lunch

it always seems that way, until you discover a counterfeit skeleton

i am out of help. i just helped the fish get out of the aquarium

not surreal enough

first, it helps you understand which chicken it was

soviet candy

writing and stage performing. and if video/film exists and audio/records exist, then i would also spend quite a bit of time film making and making records

so good it should be illegal

send someone a package

be nice to the test dummy. they are invincible

no holidays planned currently

the nutcracker

insanely good

what the heck is a neon effect

i am an honorary idiot

pretty good, it seems to be getting louder

2 thoughts come to mind. how could something so lovely be so terrible and how could something terrible be so lovely

oh now i am curious as to who is in second place

very good christmas gift

that would be pretty convenient,

that depends if you are allowed to put them in the vault

i always wonder if they even realize that they will soon look back on this time period as the time before i started

nothing is funny

the world is bent

tell him to make a rap record. very good luck to make a rap record while having a messed up jaw

i have always been expecting it, but it never seems to arrive

it's been christmas for several weeks or even months now

drink

hm, that would have some interesting effects on the global economy

it's pretty good

that all hinges upon whether or not you are reading the questions in the same order as me

yes, but to make it fair he is also very good at talking about other people's movies; because he seems to have seen and memorized all of them, including the ending credits

i'm beginning to think it might be steve

no, in fact if you want to ruin water, it's easy, all you gotta do is get it wet

christmas is the best time to work, while everyone else is distracted staring at trees and each other's family

no

hi santa, it's nice to meet you although i didn't expect you to be so muscular

very strong, muscular,

mostly space ships and friend ship

impossibe. it can't be done

how about you frown at me instead

every way i can think of. over the course of 10 years, that's a lot of ways

present and depict it. depiction and presentation are highly joyful activities

it's kind of like a boat

i'm building a boat

get a permit, that's the proper way to do it, but not the funny way

could be you

what do you want to be asked, what do you want to be asked

questions

this is good fortune, you now have many meteors to choose from

i didn't think so but now that you mention it it feels like i did

enough to wanna do something about it

insanely good or at least average

yes, they each have a different value. this one is 3.3

i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite

i will provide adequate description in due time, if not already

only on touch screens, never on keyboards

the football used in the super bowl

i am trying to say but it changes so fast

it is the steady transition through time that makes your existence possible

because i answered someone else's question instead

people stare at their pets all the time. it is only fair that the pet stares back sometimes, maybe even put you in a cage, feed you chopped liver,

i would prefer to make a new one to like the most

present and depict it. depiction and presentation are highly joyful activities

hopefully the ability to give

before making each song, the potential idea of the song i am about to make is what i prefer. with each song i am attempting to make it the way i prefer. hopefully that makes sense

i think i am in one

it's gonna have to be you

holy smokes you are very friendly

rhinoceros

if you are playing only that instrument alone, then your best bet is to try to do something like a guitar, but that might be a bit strange and you'll have to play at the highest reaches of the instrument. to get the most out of the instrument, i recommend playing it in a group setting with other 'treble' instruments, or you can put on recordings of your favorite songs and kill the bass frequencies in the EQ of the recording, and then you've got yourself a free play-along record

it occasionally might scare me until i get too scared and then i tell the fear to back off

ah, that explains why people keep going back and forth through the door all the time

there's really no minutes and seconds anywhere besides earth, unless an earthling is somehow planning to conquer it

as fate would have it, 'spirituality' is the world's least spiritual word. so that may complicate this topic

it might not be what you're used to

unannounced (when you are not expecting there to be comedy)

due to causation, and reasons

nostalgia

do the unthinkable: do an outline of a story before writing it

seems a little low

that would certainly be convenient

i will decide later

are you challenging me to a race, if so i accept

now that's what i call, intellectual blast

intellectual blast

what the heck is neon

just one of the great mysteries

1.45

well, the fact that there's infinite things makes it make a lot more sense. in that case, any cross section can be seen as equally complete

let me think

it happens automatically

it's the other way around, the songs are what i thought of

you'll never know until you are already writing it

i would generously shower them in heaps of business cards

*crowded house voice* "everywhere you go"

you are 3 potatoes, entire

all of the india ones

good

not anything

both

i want to believe you
i will consult with my team

that's not true

yes i do

no

pretty good

only if it is preparation to go into a video
video

something very round, and curvy

yes

it is the most color

the industrial revolution, various other revolutions,

how did shapes get so square

it's times like these it would be convenient to be in one of the other countries

both in due time

can't pick a favorite carrot. one thing i have learned about this life is carrots always change

i most likely answered someone else's question instead

learn a very cool lesson for now, and bring it next time. the lesson is that you should have brought it

that makes sense

to get access to some of the fantastic cures there are for that, which make you better than you were before you started

that is my nick name, but my full name is regular brain

computer keyboards are not volume sensitive. so, if you think you have any inclinations resembling anything like dancing or drumming, or grooving out in any sort of way, or if you would like to actually 'play' anything, then the music keyboard is going to be an avenue that will allow you to definitely express this to the computer in a real way

i was going to see if i could make a little bit more than that

at least 100, with that attitude

no

yes

i am working on putting grass on the moon, which i think might change your perspective

no

someone's gotta do it

yes that sounds familiar

yes, or small, one thing i would like to add is it also works if you have an extremely medium sized ego

ah, #relatable

yes and no

it's like mush, if it were smushed a little bit more

i would prefer to make a new piece of work of which to be most proud

picked it up, juggled it, planted it, harvested it, inhaled it, weaponized it, cannibalized it, several times but not nearly in that order

i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes

you would think they could do it to each other, and form a symbiotic relationship

use it as a staircase

for stylization purposes

listen to a soothing audio book, from the great Keanu Reeves

that's true i have that too

being normal

funny you should ask

i think it is supposed to musically envoke the feeling of typewriters. if you go back another 10 years, they had the sound of typewriters in the background instead of music

no

could be a big year for kiwi fruits

zero. i am unrickrollable, except for one time i rickrolled myself

because round lenses are easier to make and square screens are easier to make

almost

that makes sense

don't even get me started

yes, i just thought of one

red and green but it tastes clear

i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite

i keep failing at the part where you're supposed to like triscuits

relatable

the good news is you appear to have access to the internet, and therefore i can suggest you google a toilet disassembly service. they will take apart the toilet

it seems like you got it figured out

cursed. even worse than new years resolutions. if you want to make a resolution, i am begging you, please make sure it is not related to the beginning of any calendar period. unless you would prefer it to fail

that is a reflection of the epicness of our society

yes but so do other people

of what

would try to explain how to spell chattanooga

no

for that particular one, it might have been the extremely limited amount of time to record it

no way

2 questions come to mind. how could something so lovely be so terrible and how could something terrible be so lovely

quail time

that would be convenient

no

that would be convenient

become a fortune teller

that's not my opinion, that was yours

they were wondering how to make you do it

that's ok

it is somehow warm and hot at the same time

you could email it off your wrist

so are you

that would be impossible. favorite songs can only exist during a shorter period of time

everything, one at a time, then cancelling each one

music

you're doing great

computers

they don't really wanna teach it anymore

a little bit of nourishment is all it takes

yes

oh that would explain a lot

part way

i will show you my captcha scores, i will take an oath also

yes, absolutely

getting a business card handed to you

i actually i want the mall, but i doubt it still exists

try to get even further

none. i balance everything on top of each other

now you've got me thinking

nice, very alive, possible to think on this planet. due to breathing and being alive, etc

art imitating life
to feel better

yes

120000

you are doing a great job

living in society, i am able to mirror the incredible qualities of society

put it in the refrigerator

creative things are good and nice, and no matter how long they may last, you can still make more after that. if you simply don't believe that creative things can be good and nice in the first place, that's another issue which can be solved in court any day

when frolicking is a little more accepted in society

You seem pretty good with words/writing. how about doing some writing

sort of

yes, and cat

<a href="https://scrabbleplayers.org/w/Welcome_to_NASPAWiki">sure</a>

i don't think there are any steve's in that song, nor anyone claiming to be steve. that is for sure a steveless song

this one
it made me realize that the best question i've ever been asked is not the one i previously thought it was (it is this one instead)

no, i am always either over or under doing it in some way

i will attempt

surprise, that's not on film

think about time, the hours/minutes of the day in more detail

no

i am in the process of figuring that out

hold on i am not done turning yet

oh that would explain a lot

pinecone,

that makes sense

it has done it before

only if i believe you

ok great. i will begin making arrangements for that

i was hoping to do it

1 second, unless for some reason the question stirs some deep eternal conflict in my soul
yes

sure. to check if 7267 is divisible by 7, we can knock off the 7s (26) now we just have to check if 26 is divisible by 7, and it's clearly not because your local multiples of 7 are 21 and 28, not 26. so if 26 is not divisible by 7, we know by extension that 7267 is not either. because to get from 26 to 7267, you have to multiply by 10, add 7, and add 7000. multiplying by 10 will never change whether something is a multiple of 7. and adding more multiples of 7 will never change whether or not something is a multiple of 7. so if 26 is not a multiple of 7, then you know 7267 is not either. congratulations, now you are supposed to check 7267 for 11, assuming you have already checked for 3 which is much easier and i assume you already know how to do

yes
that's true
that's exactly right

yes

no

for each chicken, the egg is first. that egg came from a chicken also, but that was the previous chicken

yes, thank you for checking with me first

i have never been asked a weird question

How To Make Money Off Millennials, by Fund Snatcherson
very heavy. does not blow away in the wind like some other books

yes! there are many tips, and you can learn all of them by attempting to write projects. i could give you specific tips, but only if i know what particular project you are on and how it's been going so far

probably not

maybe it comes down to whether or not you really believe that you have it in you to be who you want to be. maybe it would help to read/watch some biographical content, and find out about all the many different flavours of mistakes that successful people have made, and still may continue to make. you can start to relate to them

they are fueled by capitalism. you insert capitalism into the slot, and then it rewards you with frozen yogurt

no but it's on my to do list

it's best on the way from 1 temperature to another

yes

either southern north america or northern south america

yes, thank you for checking with me first

only in story telling

i dare you to try

i think i started when i was 2 but i am still learning it

yes

onion ring

sure

that's a good idea. i will go there on monday

it may attempt to be. but does not always succeed

the television

you are right about that, i must say

could be a deepfake duck (deepfuck)

i have never done a funny song
that would certainly be convenient

yes it absolutely is

you could probably do it in a helicopter

the wheel certainly helps<br>

s

i'm pretty sure i will be soon
that's what i'm doing now

if you want something shiny you will definitely want to go with plastic

it seems like the fact that you are asking this question means you want to express yourself. so the courage will be there, if that's what you want. the rest is just spending time with it. and remember the golden rule, which is that at every level of experience, even the highest levels, there is a certain element of 'here is a pile of crap, you will like this crap.' what the heck, i do that every day, what with telling people my favorite cereal is marbles. or maybe some people may view that answer as just the perfect answer. at every level of art there is a certain degree of 'World Renowned Artist Presents: Crap.' Look at even the most well respected pieces of art. You can see how they're crap if you put yourself in the artist's shoes. (is anyone going to think this is good, or is it just crap). So go ahead and adopt that mindset early, and that should allow you to have a nice rebellious good time, in the meantime, while you are gradually and unassumingly accumulating genuine experience, which will inevitably happen over time

i think you are doing ok
it is just the right amount
sure

that depends which ones you already know

every day is favorite day. this is favorite week

the music itself, or perhaps the ability to enhance the potency of anything the music is applied to

science

to add emphasis

bic mechanical pencil

comcast

it helps challenge me to find and cultivate answers. i am an answer cultivator

did you ask first if you could ask that question

try drinking water. water is the elixir of life

if i were you i would try to write something during that time. maybe set up a reminder to remind you to do it

the hollywood crab

i think you should search for a new game to be interested in. there must be billions of games out there. make it a hunt to find the right game. unless, you have reached the age where you are in a state of panic about your life's accomplishments, in which case i would suggest you get started on making your own game

magical things happen and then it's on you to figure out how the hell that happened. then, for the twist, as soon as you think you've figured it out, the music insists on delivering the magic in a different way. great fun for schools and families alike

holy smokes, you are very friendly

yamaha maple custom

take on some new projects. maybe something you've always wanted to work on but never got to it

changes in space over time, and changes in time over space

that is very convenient

a bowl of mac and cheese

i dare you to try

the element of surprise

probably. it has happened before

for research purposes

i want so desperately not to like it, but i love it

me too

i wonder if there will ever be peace, in the stars

it's impossible in a short time. it's very easy over a long period of time

can't. typing is cancelled. the computer will figure out what you want to say based on your past purchases

my entire life, i think
no

only

no

i think you might be mixing a few different worlds here

rice plops

how about a football

yes! only if you put bugs in them

they are a dog's best friend

that's ok

it's like a chair, for objects

a wheel barrow

1 of them is. you are supposed to guess which one

it seems no one could ever figure out how not to

book tour!

the only way to really know anything about that is to start trying it. it's like being a taste tester

a wheel barrow. maybe a 10 pack of wheel barrows. just kidding, don't want the wheel barrows. cancel the wheel barrows please

try to find a more quiet space, or try using a personal sound isolation device (ear plugs, isolation headphones, etc)

that is the preferred outcome. i have learned that the best way to get depth in a song is to get the song in the right mood and it will dig itself

i am living amongst an idea flood. the only challenge is not to drown

start by not knowing how. that will give you a good start

why does my dog eat leaves

for the taste

a personal floor, strapped to each foot

i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes. well, it's a berg with ice on top. and it is a relatively large berg, lots of places to explore, so it's hard to feel trapped, although in a way i am trapped. unless i spend a lot of money on some type of plane

yes! they are in the mirror

that may be true

i think you may be forgetting something, which is that over the course of the last 100 years, technology has adavanced such that books are now far less than being the only/best way to learn. in fact quite inefficient in some ways because they are not searchable and can't be updated after they are printed

i have never come up with anything called let it be, but speaking on behalf of someone who did, i can tell you that Paul McCartney came up with a song called 'let it be' based on a dream where his mother turned up (back from the dead, etc) and told him everything's gonna be ok, just let it be. her name was Mary. hope that helps

the one in the pyramids of egypt

would be 0 lasagnas; they should cancel each other out

sure

give them fake coupons for stuff

i guess there's only one way to find out

it's good for managing entire batches of numbers, all at once

something relating to sound

if you want the numbers to be lower, i would definitely recommend celsius

yes, it would also make sense for the word 'would' to not have the letter L, but for some reason that's just the way everyone around me has always done it for my entire life. so if i changed it now i might confuse myself and possibly others too

corn chops

that would certainly be convenient
i am back

yes, 3rds don't work too well and if you try to go all the way around you are bitten by the wolfe

fame can be traumatizing. so i guess it just depends how early you'd wish to be traumatized

you'll have to learn more things, to pile on top of that

wild melon

if you are the kind of person that would not like it done on you, then it would be nice if you could uphold some kind of mutual understanding with everyone else, where by no one does violence on each other

i know absolutely nothing about the academic world. but being confused at this time in your life will hopefully lead to some interesting discoveries

pineapple is pizza

they keep me grounded

yes absolutely although you are not helping me keep it secret

yes i have several

entire meals

yes although i admit it is hard to believe. despite the fact that belief is only made possible by life

ask the store if it wants anything

that's proposterous. who do you think i am

don't worry i'm going to fix it

i'm not sure, that might be getting into questionable territory

it's actually a very narrow range

maybe 12, depending on how you might feel like thinking of it

as soon as i figure out what the hell it is, i'm sure i will like it

save all your ideas, but also try to write much much much much shorter books first. the universe can unravel at any moment, and every moment. a book is a lot of moments. start with just 1 or 2 moments, so you can practice wrangling the universe, 1 moment at a time

for all the things i so desperately wish to do, i need probably 20 to 40 years to practice, but in reality i should probably be thinking on a tighter time table

oh that sounds like fun

insecurity actually makes this worse
i think it gets stronger the more music you listen to, especially if you are listening to music which has been recorded to click (that's almost all music nowadays). then, at show time, just remember that you are responsible for carrying the band and the audience. it's like carrying your children to safety. you won't do it perfectly, no one would, and no one wants to judge you or be mad at you for doing it wrong. they just need to be delivered to their destination safely. their life is in your hands. take care of them and own up to the responsibility. someone's gotta do it

billiards, croquet, filling out forms,

i'm not sure, i will have to pinch myself to find out

pineapple is pizza

oh you are in luck; Upload is my middle name

right away! i got an upload machine that should help

38

what the heck is a valentine

no, that would not qualify as a day ruining thing. and usually i am alerted to sock holes by feel, not by looking at them

how about a real live velcro experience

yes. almost too cool. it makes me nervous

i don't think so

sleep on it

holy smokes, you are very friendly

yes absolutely, that sounds lovely and very peaceful

i do not, i typically do 1 or 2 answer sessions per day, but now for a question of my own, which is are You ok

well, no, you would have to replace the bread with normal everyday bread as well

i just want to clarify that a little bit, it was more gradual than that. i had 9000 subscribers on youtube before the japan video came out, and 100,000 on vine

ice cactus

it's pretty good, i like all the lights that come on

extremely
yes

well, that would certainly be convenient i must say

sure, if it doesn't adopt you first. think of it as a race

i will do it when i get a chance

it is you, you are pickle fish

those are all nouns

not quite

it's a song. as with many songs, it's not entirely clear what it's about, but i think it has echoes of bravery and courage and trying to make it in society in your own unique way

that would definitely come in handy

lego sports

yes

by writing fiction. considering that's probably what got you into this mess in the first place

sounds like you've got it under control

i just crawl around mostly

they are trying to figure that out as soon as they can

it's very good. wait, which one do you have

in the earth's core

no

there is no muffin man. muffins are made by machines now

new year's resolutions are famous for failure. so when i make resolutions i am very careful to make sure that they have nothing to do with new years

put it into the hands of the person it's for

the proper way to consume a soap dispenser is to use it to dispense soap, and the proper way to consume soap is to clean things with it

they are on twitter at @billwurtz, but as an added bonus i will also be making more, in addition to the ones which are already there

me too but i am trying to explain

alaska airlines might be good

holy smokes, you are very friendly
medium
no
pretty good

holy smokes, you are very friendly

sure

maybe person 2 will start to care about person 1 if person 1 starts to care about person 2. all it takes is 1 move, of caring, to get the ball going

feeling unemboldened for a little while

immediately after feeling unemboldened for a little while

spank it

i think they already did the business. 1000 years ago

there is no cheese. the moon exists in a cheeseless environment. nasa has proved this, as they have tried to demonstrate in a dramatic re-enactment, broadcasted live from a video tape

no but you can try being a worth earm, the next best thing

i dare you to try

no more grammar. we used it all up, in sentences

your Father

google earth

save the pineapples for the bedroom

vegetable

yes it's joseph

it sounds like you have done everything you can for now. now try to focus on everything else besides the vocal, and see if that helps (it will)

take a break from microwaves for a little while

jazz chords are actually just normal chords. jazz actually doesn't really mean anything anymore, it's just a cool word

pretty good, i give it 2 stars. 1 star for temperature, and a second star because it's also a drink

it's pretty good

of course

musical scoring is the ultimate secret weapon. it makes people like the main content better and they have no idea that that's the reason. it's like that little bit of crack cocaine grandma used to slip into the spaghetti back home. You can tell in this case, even a lot of the musicians focus on the separate side dish of crack cocaine, not even realizing that the crack cocaine has actually been laced through every strand of spaghetti, in addition. they might think it's just good spaghetti, but it is truly the crack cocaine that enhances the flavour

try to incentivize the commercial space travel industry

try to act naturally

that's because everyone is so lovable
fall in love with everyone, then there will be no one left to fall in love with

could be brainerd

i'm not sure, but one thing i know is this much is not enough

if you really want the leg room you're gonna need waffles. especially if you have an exorbitantly high number of legs

i am a hybrid between all 3. cat/dog/person

it has an ongoing special agreement with reality

no, i have banished ketchup

yes, sometimes 2 sandwiches

i am in the process of colonizing myself

everything

i would do a re make of every song, which fortunately includes that one

darkness, while being very grateful and thankful that the world is not usually this dark. in the southern hemisphere it takes a bit of reverse psychology to get this

it's just me. i made the sound, and then i play the sound. the sound is made with a lot of options for the player, so the player matters on this one, just as much as the maker. which in this case are both me. i was going to say that i used seahorses, but that's not true, i did not

i check the weather first, which doesn't matter because it always changes anyway. then songs will occur, depending on the changed weather

first the milk, then a bunch of seahorses, then cereal, for the sea horses to eat

that's true

it doesn't matter now, what's important is how to fix it. you gotta move it back. and to prevent it in the future, you wanna make sure no one else moves it
or maybe you could rotate your house, around the couch

the logo for the seahorse is a seahorse

new update out of switzerland this morning, cereal is considered a sandwich

don't worms have skeletons? is there any chance i could be a worm skeleton. nevermind, save the offer for another day. i appreciate the opportunity

i thought all songs were like that

holy smokes, you are very friendly

i know you would expect it to be your brain but it's actually sacremento

sometimes you can use reverse psychology

i almost did not even think of that

sometimes you can use reverse psychology

i was going to hopefully make all the videos
every day would be good, that would seem convenient for everyone, including myself
was envisioning some larger type of wave

you must interrupt him, with hornier songs, more horny than he may have ever thought possible

doing it now

it can dream

not hard enough

that's true, but don't forget how much easier all those inventors' lives were made, by all the inventions that came before. now it's your turn

every week!

yes, that is exactly what i do

it damn better well not be

the golden rule is the song wants to surprise you. by switching between being simple and not simple. with neither too much regularity nor irregularity

yes, i have done that

yes, i will do it

no

the entire solar system

in a musical way. i imagine things sung. that accomplishes 2 things at the same time; it tells me both the lyric and melody

a potato holder. i have so many potatoes but nothing to hold them

pots and pans,

holy smokes, you are very friendly

*birds flying*

it was following another road. going through an intersection with the first road

i would say hello, and then it's the other person's turn. to say something

the whole freakin rules

it might be your own beliefs that you have projected somehow onto me
i have never talked about that. i respect rich people, and their beliefs
that may be true but i did not say that
not quite yet, but it sounds very much like you just explained your own beliefs and tried very hard to infer that they are my beliefs too. those are not bad beliefs, they are very good beliefs. but they originated from you as you wrote the
