is new zealand real

really cool people happen to me sometimes and do a lot for me, and i thus far have failed to reciprocate well. clearly they also have needs. and something i have is adjacent to said needs, but adolescent at best. the way i act suggests i want to be a fun toy they give attention, forever. this obviously sucks and i super want to be someone who can do for them what they do for me. to be as old and shit as i am i clearly have not bent every effort, to incorporate anddevelop these magic gifts i get randomly. maybe a people person type of job would give me more opportunity to train. or i could fall into my bad habits and the time would be wasted, though i feel i may be getting too strong for that now. the magic gifts are artifacts of im not sure but surely a path much different than what i've done.

BILL, AT sorry my capslock was on. At the start of this year I travelled overseas for the first time and was lying on the terminal floor with my travel buddy waiting for the flight out. I was absolutely crapping myself with anxiety coz when I was a kid I witnessed a fatal plane accident and I'd never been over water in a plane and was overthinking like crazy. Anyway. I opened up YouTube for the first time in ages to try to find something to distract myself and at the top was Airport Terminal. I thought "oh wow that's a cool coincidence" and I watched it and it calmed me right down because it made the whole experience seem like a cool adventure. Thanks very much for unknowingly helping me. Also, the editing in that video is fucking stupendous and it blows my mind to think of the amount of work you put into it.

I still think a keyboard could be an invaluable tool for quickly sketching out ideas for me though, given my short attention span, so I suppose I'll just have to try it myself.<br/>bonus question: does capitalizing only "I" make me narcissistic?

help me I'm dying inside

i have surgery soon and they're putting me under sedation that will knock me out for a few hours but give me amnesia for like, most of the day. i fucking hate the idea of being conscious but not being able to form memories even if it's just for a day, it's making me feel sad and useless on an almost existential level to think about it, not to mention i'm worried i'll say something stupid. can you please suggest how i can cope with this

What is your favorite type of crab?

hey, do you have any suggestions for things (preferably fun) i can do to keep me occupied during winter break which began today? when i can't find something to do i end up turning to playing on a certain minecraft server, but that is bad for me in many ways and usually does not end up well as once i start it is hard not to do it with the right form of moderation. something fun i already know i can do is go to places and do things (the pool, sledding, snow tubing) with some people, but they're not always available and there is plenty of time left where i can't find something to keep me occupied. i can occasionally get busy with creative stuff, but it generally requires a sudden rush of purpose and motivation for something, even if it's a really small thing. thanks, can't wait for your new stuff&#128516;&#128512;

This past quarter of high school I let a lot of missing assignments get out of hand because I was focusing on studying music. As a result, I'm now barely passing a couple of my academic classes. I'm worried about what my parents will say when they find out, as they have very high standards for me, but they know that I plan on studying music in college and my grades in all of my music classes are really good. <br/><br/>Should I be worried about my grades in classes not pertaining to the career field I plan on pursuing? Should I consider this a waking call to do better academically next semester, or continue focusing more on my music? Should I even be worried about what my parents say, or focus on what's more important to me personally?

It's weird trying to infer your stance on capitalism. Getting a huge "Christmas kinda sucks" vibe maybe because of capitalism(???)
meaning the commodification, propaganda, distribution, and sale of this weird red fat dude, who's a way way way bastardized representation of Jesus,. .is kinda absurd .. given all the resources and stuff wasted.... just a guess. .Also Rock and roll Confusion, the video. and the audio journal 'bout "pirates looting booty". It seems like rich people being shitty is a thing you sometimes talk about.
Except for that one time in Movie Star where you empathize with a dude who lives in a cool house. maybe there are others. <br/><br/>but when you were asked before about being anticapitalist or having those views I think you were like "but making money, like...you need to".
So I guess what I'm asking is/was this something you think about? care to share findings of research on this topic?
