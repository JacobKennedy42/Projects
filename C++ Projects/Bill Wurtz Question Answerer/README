This program uses a supervised neural net to form answers to questions pulled
from billwurtz.com/questions/questions.html. The goal of the net is to answer
questions in a style similar to musician Bill Wurtz. The program starts with
the shortest questions first.
The net uses the RMSprop algorithm to adjust its values. The net also steadily
increases its learning rate during times of stagnation, and then resets it if
values appear to stop converging. New samples are added when the average cost
per character is <.01, where 1 is the cost between 2 adjacent ascii characters
(Ex: F and G).

This program is meant to be run in terminal and uses curl to get the questions
and answers. You may download the curl devloper package using the following:

	sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

To run the net with a given sample net and sample questions, enter:

	make clean runNet

Then enter the number of questions you want the net to learn before printing
the results. The sample net has already learned the answers to more than 30
questions.

To erase the existing neural net and run a new blank net, enter:

	make rmSaves runNet

To update the data with the most recent questions, enter:

	make clean getData

To restore the net and questions with the given samples, enter:

	make restoreSamples
