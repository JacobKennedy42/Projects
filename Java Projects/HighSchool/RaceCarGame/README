This program simulates a car driving down a road full of road spikes. The goal of the car is to drive a certain distance without hitting a spike. If it does, it is marked a WIN. If it hits a spike, it is marked a HIT.
When the car completes a run, it modifies a file called RaceCarGameData.txt, so that it may avoid spikes better in the future.

How to Run:
	In a linux terminal, cd into this directory and enter the following command:

		java RaceCarGame

	Type /reset to reset the car's memory. Otherwise, type in the number of runs you would like to do.
