# Projects
A collection of personal projects throughout the years.
Note: All projects included were either created independently from academic course work (such as all my neural net projects), or done for a course but not chosen specifically by the instructor (for example, the Cryptocurrency project was done as a final project for a summer networking course).
Instructions on how to run each project are located in each project's README
